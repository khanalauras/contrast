I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Beloit College. I have technical skills in developing, testing, and evaluating automated pipelines and contemporary machine-learning models for natural languguage processing and cybersecurity. Furthermore, I am fluent in programming SQL scripts for data engineering using big data software and effective at gathering and communicating valuable insights from disparate data using visualizations and business reports.
